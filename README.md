# SpotifyEchoNestPlaylistDemo

This is a little demo app that shows how to call the Echo Nest API from within a Spotify App. To run this
app add it to your Spotify directory (on a Mac its ~/Spotify/playlister).  Load the app by typing:

      spotify:app:SpotifyEchoNestPlaylistDemo

in the search bar. The app will create a list of tracks for the given seed artist.   Press the button to
generate another playlist.

You should use your own Echo Nest API key. Replace the demo key (N6E4NIOVYMTHNDM8J) with your own key to
get full API access.
